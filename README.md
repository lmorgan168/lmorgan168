## Welcome to my Github Profile! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Lucas (or Luke). I love all things data and machine learning. Outside of coding, I love exploring and reviewing new cuisines, watching football and basketball, and enjoying the intersection of sports and data.

Check out my [Portfolio](lmorgan168.github.io) to see my projects in action.
